\subsection{Detection algorithm}
The purpose of the detection algorithm is to detect potentially too exposed devices. It analyzes the LoRa traffic, keeps track of all the detected DevAddress, and uses a pattern-matching strategy to verify if two collected DevAddress could be associated with the same ED.

\vspace{5mm}

In detail, the detection algorithm uses a vector \(\ C \) to store all the identified patterns. It contains a series of elements \(\ P_{a} \), where \(\ a \) is the current DevAddress associated to an ED, and \(\ P_{a} = \{ s_{1}, ..., s_{n} \} \) is the pattern the device follows. Since different patterns necessarily describe distinct EDs, in \(\ C \), there cannot be two tuples denoting the same device. In other words, let \(\ E \) be the set of all the ED that currently join the network, we have:
\[\ length(C) \subseteq length(E ) \]
The vector \(\ C \) allows checking if a given device, represented by its current DevAddres \(\ a \), already exchanged messages in the network. When the detection algorithm reads a new packet with DevAddress \(\ a \), it observe if the condition \(\ P_{a} \in C \) occurs. If \(\ P_{a} \notin C \) and this happens after the interception of a Join-request message, PIVOT  cannot establish \textit{a priori} the nature of the device associated to \(\ a \). It initiates a pattern-matching process to compute if \(\ a \) belongs to a new device or a re-joined one, trying to achieve this task in the shortest time possible. In this way, in the case of potential matching, the algorithm minimizes the delay in triggering the alert.

Intercepting a Join-request message is a crucial part of the detection process. It permits PIVOT to comprehend which addresses it needs to investigate and which patterns we should use for the matching procedure. The pattern \(\ P_{a} \notin C \), associated with an unknown address \(\ a \), should \textit{not} be compared with all the other patterns of \(\ C \). We must exclude from our analysis all that pattern related to these two classes of addresses:

\vspace{3mm}
\begin{itemize}
	\item All the addresses collected after the Join request, which have been noticed also before the Join-request. They are associated with devices that never disconnect from the network.
	\item All the other unknown addresses received after the Join-request, since a new device that joins the network has not more than one DevAddr.
\end{itemize}

The algorithm follows two sequential steps, called \textit{Pre-Join} procedure and \textit{Main} procedure. Figure \ref{fig:pre_main} illustrates the two procedures. Let \(\ t_{0} \) the timestamp of the first packet received by PIVOT after its activation and \(\ t_{f} \) the timestamp of the first Join-request packet. The Pre-Join procedure takes place in the time window \(\ t_{f} - t_{0} \) and the Main procedure starts after the reception of the first Join-Request message, at \(\ t_{f} \). In the next sections, we are going to examine these two steps in detail.
